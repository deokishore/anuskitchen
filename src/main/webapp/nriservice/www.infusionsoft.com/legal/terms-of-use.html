Late payments shall be subject to a service charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum charge permitted by law, whichever is less.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Taxes.</strong> You shall pay all personal property, sales, use, value-added, withholding and similar taxes (other than taxes on Infusionsoft&#39;s net income) arising from the transactions described in this Agreement, even if such amounts are not listed on an Order Form. To the extent You are exempt from sales or other taxes, You agree to provide Infusionsoft, upon request, with the appropriate exemption certificate.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Non-Payment; Other Suspension Rights.</strong> Infusionsoft may terminate the Infusionsoft Service if the billing or contact information provided by You is false or fraudulent. Infusionsoft also reserves the right, in its discretion, to suspend Your access and/or use of the Infusionsoft Service: (i) where any payment is due but unpaid and You have been requested but failed to promptly cure such payment failure; or (ii) in the event a dispute arises on Your account as to who at Your business has authority to act or manage Your account and Infusionsoft is not promptly provided with written instructions from the interested parties associated with Your account that fully resolves the dispute. You acknowledge and agree that it a dispute arises as to management of Your account, then (i) if the listed owner of the account is a corporation, limited liability company or other registered entity, Infusionsoft may rely on public records (to the extent available) concerning the appropriate authorized executives or managers of Your entity; or (ii) if the listed owner is a dba or sole proprietorship, or any other entity for which public records of control are not readily accessible online, Infusionsoft may assume that the person or entity that has been making payments on Your account has the authority to manage the account. You agree that Infusionsoft shall not be liable to You nor to any third party for any suspension of the Infusionsoft Service resulting from Your non-payment of Fees or from a dispute as to the management rights to Your account.</p>
<h2>Article IV. Confidentiality; Use of Names</h2>
<p><strong>4.1 Confidential Information.</strong> For purposes of this Agreement, confidential information shall include the business terms in the Order Form, Your Data, the Infusionsoft Service and the Infusionsoft Materials, and any information that is clearly identified in writing at the time of disclosure as confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be confidential by the receiving party given the nature of the information and the circumstances of its disclosure (&quot;Confidential Information&quot;). Each party agrees: (a) to receive and maintain in confidence all Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party or by a third-party; (b) not to use the Confidential Information of the other party except to the extent necessary to perform its obligations or exercise rights hereunder; (c) to limit the internal dissemination of Confidential Information to those employees and contractors of the recipient who have a need to know and an obligation to protect it; and (d) to protect the confidentiality thereof in the same manner as it protects the confidentiality of similar information and data of its own (at all times exercising at least a reasonable degree of care in the protection of such Confidential Information). Infusionsoft will restrict its employees&#39; access to Your Confidential Information to only those employees necessary to successfully provide the Infusionsoft Service. Infusionsoft may disclose Confidential Information on a need-to-know basis to its contractors who have executed written agreements requiring them to maintain such information in strict confidence and use it only to facilitate the performance of their services for Infusionsoft in connection with the performance of this Agreement. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (1) is known publicly; (2) is generally known in the industry before disclosure; (3) has become known publicly, without fault of the recipient, subsequent to disclosure by the disclosing party; or (4) the recipient becomes aware of from a third party not bound by non-disclosure obligations to the disclosing party and with the lawful right to disclose such information to the recipient. This Section will not be construed to prohibit the disclosure of Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or order of a court or other governmental authority. The parties agree to give the other party prompt notice of the receipt of any subpoena or other similar request for such disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Credit Card Information.</strong> Infusionsoft agrees that it will retain and store any provided credit card information only for the minimum amount of time required for business, legal and/or regulatory purposes, and will use standard industry practices to protect such information from unauthorized access, disclosure or use.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Use of Names in Marketing.</strong> You may use Infusionsoft&#39;s name and credentials in an appropriate and acceptable manner for Your standard marketing promotions, provided that You agree to cease or alter such use at Infusionsoft&#39;s request where such use is contrary to Infusionsoft&#39;s branding policies, could cause any brand confusion in the market or is otherwise objectionable to Infusionsoft. Similarly, Infusionsoft may use Your business name in an appropriate and acceptable manner for standard marketing promotions, provided that Infusionsoft agrees to cease or alter such use at Your request where such use is contrary to Your branding policies, could cause any brand confusion in the market or is otherwise objectionable to You. Acceptable and standard marketing promotions include, but are not limited to: client listings, press releases, surveys, interviews, reputable business publications, television, and web site presentation and promotion, etc.</p>

<p><strong>7.3 Integration; Modification.</strong> This Agreement and the information incorporated into this Agreement by written reference (including reference to information contained in a URL or referenced policy), together with any applicable Order Form, represent the parties&#39; entire understanding relating to the Infusionsoft Service, the Infusionsoft Materials and the Services, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous, conflicting or additional communications. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may only be amended by written agreement of the parties.</p>
<p><strong>7.4 Governing Law; Arbitration.</strong> This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Arizona without giving effect to conflict of laws principles. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or concerning the respective rights or obligations of the parties hereto shall be settled and determined by arbitration before a panel of one (1) arbitrator in Maricopa County, Arizona, pursuant to the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the power to award damages, injunctive relief and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses to the prevailing party.</p>
<p><strong>7.5 Force Majeure.</strong> Except for Your obligation to pay Fees for the Infusionsoft Service or other Services rendered, neither party will be responsible for failure of performance due to causes beyond its control. Such causes include (without limitation) accidents, acts of God, labor disputes, actions of any government agency, shortage of materials, acts of terrorism, or the stability or availability of the Internet or a portion thereof.</p>
<p><strong>7.6 Export.</strong> You agree that U.S. export control laws and other applicable export and import laws govern Your use of the Infusionsoft Service, including Infusionsoft technology. You represent that You are neither a citizen of an embargoed country nor prohibited end user under applicable U.S. export or anti-terrorism laws, regulations and lists. You agree not to use or export, nor allow a third party to use or export, the Infusionsoft Service or technology in any manner that would violate applicable law, including but not limited to applicable export and import control laws and regulations.</p>
<p><strong>7.7 Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><strong>7.8 Relationship of Parties.</strong> No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between Infusionsoft and You as a result of this Agreement or use of the Infusionsoft Service.</p>
<p><strong>7.9 Waiver.</strong> The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by such party in writing.</p>
<p><strong>7.10 Invalidity; Waivers.</strong> If any provision or portion of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable as it appears in this Agreement by reason of any rule of law, administrative or judicial provision or public policy, then such provision shall be construed as being enforceable to the extent such rule of law, administrative or judicial provision or public policy allows. All other provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Neither of the parties shall be deemed to have waived any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder unless the waiving party expresses such a waiver in writing.</p>
<p><strong>7.11 Government End Use.</strong> If You are an agency or unit of the U.S. Government (&quot;Government&quot;), the Infusionsoft Service is provided for ultimate Government use solely in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (&quot;FAR&quot;) and supplements thereto, including the Department of Defense (&quot;DoD&quot;) FAR Supplement (&quot;DFARS&quot;, set forth in this Section. Government technical data and software rights related to the Services include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this Agreement. This customary commercial license is provided in accordance with FAR &sect;12.211 (Technical Data) and FAR &sect;12.212 (Computer Software) and, for DoD transactions, DFARS &sect; 252.227-7015 (Technical Data - Commercial Items) and DFARS &sect; 252.227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). If the Government has a need for rights not conveyed under these terms, it must negotiate with Infusionsoft to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights, and a mutually acceptable written addendum specifically conveying such rights must be included in any applicable contract or agreement.</p>
